# PHP

Undoubtedly my most embarrassing repository. Please ignore vulgar commit messages and comments in code, I was young at the time and my professor never told us about the importance or usefulness of GitHub as anything other than a could storage tool.

This repo will most likely be split so that important projects can be given their own repos.

## Projects of Interest

### projects/class
  
We were given a prompt to create a survey engine that allowed users to create their own surveys, take other surveys, and view results.

  - Each user can sign up and log in correctly
  - The surveys were required to allow for a variable number of multiple choice questions, each with 4 answers
  - styling was not required

Technologies utilized: PHP, MySQL (WAMP), HTML, CSS
  
In my version, along with nicely styling the app, I allowed the user to have much more freedom when creating surveys.

  - Surveys could, of course, have variable amounts of questions
  - Each question could have a variable number of answers
  - Answers could be three different types - text field, radio box, or check box

### projects/personal

This prompt was broader, and only specified that we use the required technologies from the previous project to create a functional WAMP site.

The project I chose to create was a social network. Key features of this social network include:

  - messaging between users
  - posting on other user's walls
  - sending and accepting friend requests

## Conclusion

It's been a long time since I've touched PHP or developed with a WAMP suite, but I'm including these projects (vulgarities and all) to show that I am capable of learning any language that is thrown at me, as well as how much I've grown both as a designer and a developer. Thank you for reading! If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
